				"<p>Logo was created in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig and Seymour Papert - researchers at MIT. Their goal was to create an easy to learn application where kids could play with words and the structure of sentences. Later versions of Logo included on screen graphics and the forward and right commands to move an on-screen 'turtle' around the screen, and it became known as Turtle graphics. In 1969, a physical robot was designed which would move across the floor tracing its path with a pen.</p>",
				
				"<p>Seymour Papert pioneered its use in school classrooms as an educational system in the early 1970's, saying:</p>",
			 
				"<p>In many schools today, the phrase 'Computer-Aided Instruction' means making the computer teach the child. One might say the computer is being used to program the child. In my vision the child programs the computer and, in so doing, both acquires a sense of mastery over a piece of the most modern and powerful technology and establishes an intimate contact with some of the deepest ideas from science, from mathematics, and from the art of intellectual model building...</p>",
			 
				"<p>...Traditional education codifies what it thinks citizens need to know and sets out to feed children this 'fish'. Constructionism is built on the assumption that children will do best by finding ('fishing') for themselves the specific knowledge that they need...the Turtle is like a person: 'I am here and I am facing north...' And from these similarities comes the Turtle's special ability to serve as a representative of formal mathematics for a child.</p>"
